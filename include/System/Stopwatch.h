	/** If STOPWATCH_STATIC_INIT is defined, then Stopwatch will use a static initialization approach to measuring the CountsPerSecond/clock frequency.  This technique
		will read from a boolean "FirstTime" variable, and if it is false it will enter into a static initialization routine protected by critical section.  If Stopwatches
		are created from multiple DLLs, this initialization may occur once for each DLL once a Stopwatch requests it in that particular DLL.

		If STOPWATCH_STATIC_INIT is not defined, then Stopwatch will call QueryPerformanceFrequency() for each Stopwatch object constructed.  On 10-10-2018 this was profiled
		to take only 4ns, although the Internet suggests that on some hardware configurations this can take a couple of microseconds.  The call is always made before the
		profile operation starts, so this should not affect the time measured. 
		
		On platforms besides Windows, there is no need for static initialization and this is not defined. **/

		/** Stopwatch calls are not thread-safe if the Stopwatch is running.  Thread-safety rules here are:

				1.	Before the Stopwatch has started or after the Stopwatch is Stop()'d or Reset() then 
					it is safe and reliable to call the read-only functions GetElapsed...() or ToString() 
					on any thread.  It is important to be sure that the Stop() or Reset() call has 
					completed before other threads call the GetElapsed...() or ToString() methods.  This
					allows profiling in one thread and then the Stop()'d result to be passed around to
					other threads as a result as long as the profiling is ensured completed before review.

				2.	It is always safe to call Stopwatch functions from multiple threads as long as the
					Stopwatch object is constrained to a single thread.  For example, if you construct 
					Stopwatch objects A and B on threads #1 and #2 respectively then it is safe to make 
					any calls on A from thread #1 and calls on B from thread #2.  It could be unsafe to 
					make calls on stopwatch object A from thread #2 or object B from thread #1 in accordance
					with rule #1 above.
